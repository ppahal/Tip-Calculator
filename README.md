## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I think the hardest part was just set up and downloading the software. Additionally, the walkthrough was not up to date with
current Swift software. I figured it out with the help of one of the tutors.
I think now the hardest part is just exploring the parts of the software that I am not the most comfortable with, but it isn't too hard to find the answers to the problems I am having now that I understand how everything works better. Although I still had difficulty with the remembering the bill part because the resources online seemed to be a bit oudated on certain aspects of code.
